# Solving the maze

This repository contains the implementation of the solution to solving mazes through the right-hand strategy.

## How this works
<hr>
Inside the "build" directory there is an executable JAR file which receives a filepath through the CLI which is supposed to contain a valid maze configuration.
<br><br>
Once the maze has loaded, it proceeds to move the player through the map by following the rightest available option to move.
